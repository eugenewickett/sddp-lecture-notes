    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explained in class, one version of the hydro-thermal scheduling problem has a collection of generators (hydro and thermal) supplying power at least cost to meet demand over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related problem focuses on a single hydro generator. Because they are small, they are a _price taker_ in the market; the market offers a price and the agent is free to sell as much power as it wants at that price.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is inspired by a hydro power station somewhere in the world. To retain confidentiality, all the data has been normalized, some of the data is missing, and the rest has been perterbed and then rounded to a lower fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a single reservoir with a minimum volume 0 units and a maximum volume of 1 unit\n",
    "2. Each week, the agent can choose to turbine a quantity of water through the turbine to produce electicity. The rate at which water (flow) is converted into electricity can be modelled by a piecewise-linear concave function, i.e.,:\n",
    "   - `generation(flow) = min_i{intercept_i + slope_i * flow}`\n",
    "   - Data for the intercept and slope coefficients are provided in the `data.json` file in the `generation_intercept` and `generation_slope` fields.\n",
    "3. In addition to turbining water, the agent can _spill_ water over the top of their reservoir.\n",
    "4. Each week, the inflow into the reservoir can be modelled by a stagewise-independent random variable. \n",
    "   - The support and probability mass of this random variable is provided in the `data.json` file in the `inflow_support` and `inflow_probabiltiy` fields.\n",
    "5. Each week, the price at which the agent can sell electricity can be modelled by a stagewise-independent random variable. \n",
    "   - The support and probability mass of this random variable is provided in the `data.json` file in the `price_support` and `price_probabiltiy` fields.\n",
    "6. The inflow and price in each week are independent of each other.\n",
    "7. At the start of week 1, there is 0.5 units of water in the reservoir.\n",
    "8. The generator has a maximum production capacity of 1 unit of electricity per week. This is the power output, not the capacity of flow through the turbine.\n",
    "9. The agent seeks a dispatch policy with a planning horizon of 1 year.\n",
    "10. To ensure that they are in a reasonable state for the following year, the agent wants to ensure that the end the year with at least as much water as they started. The violation of this constraint is penalized at a rate of \\$10,000/unit of water."
